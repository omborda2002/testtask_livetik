Task 3 Discussion:

* Eventual Consistency Concept in this context.
- In the SecurityDashboardModule, eventual consistency means that when a user changes their password in the UserManagementModule, the dashboard does not reflect the change immediately. The update appears only after the corresponding Kafka event is processed, resulting in a short delay between the password change and the dashboard displaying the new timestamp.

* What potential challenges or considerations arise from this for the data displayed in the SecurityDashboardModule?
- The SecurityDashboardModule can run into a few issues because it relies on events. There can be a delay before password changes show up on the dashboard, which might confuse administrators who expect to see updates right away. If something goes wrong with Kafka or the network, some events might not get delivered, so the dashboard could show old information until someone fixes it. If a user changes their password several times quickly, the events might arrive out of order, so the dashboard could show the wrong time for the last change. Also, sometimes the same event might be delivered more than once, so we need to make sure the dashboard doesnâ€™t update the timestamp incorrectly if it gets duplicate messages.

* What if a strictly consistent view across all modules were required for a specific operation (no implementation, just considerations)?
- Sometimes we need all modules to show exactly the same data at the same time, especially for security audits or compliance checks. There are different ways to handle this problem. The direct query approach means when we really need accurate data, the SecurityDashboardModule can ask the UserManagementModule directly instead of using its own stored information. Another way is using synchronized updates where both modules get updated at the exact same time, but this makes the system much slower. We could also add a manual refresh button that gets the latest information from the main module whenever someone clicks it. The smartest solution is to keep using the fast eventual consistency method for everyday use, but switch to direct checking when we're doing important security reports or investigations where getting the exact right time really matters.
